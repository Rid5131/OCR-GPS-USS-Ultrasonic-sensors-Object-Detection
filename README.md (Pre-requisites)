The code should work on a Raspberry Pi if the hardware setup (e.g., PiCamera, GPIO pins) is correct and all libraries (cv2, pytesseract, pyttsx3, picamera) are installed and configured.

**1. Raspberry Pi Setup (for Python-based code)
Libraries to Install:**

**a. OpenCV (for image processing in OCR):**
  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
**b. Pytesseract (for OCR):**
    sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
    pip3 install pytesseract
**c. Pyttsx3 (for Text-to-Speech):**
    pip3 install pyttsx3
**d. PiCamera (for Raspberry Pi Camera):**
    sudo apt-get install python3-picamera
**e. RPi.GPIO (for GPIO control):**
    sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio

**Steps to Run:
Install the libraries by running the above commands.
Set up your camera:**
Ensure the Raspberry Pi Camera is enabled by running:
    **sudo raspi-config**
Then, enable the camera under "Interfacing Options".
Connect the GPIO pins as mentioned in your code (e.g., ultrasonic sensor, speaker).

**Run the Python Script:**
    python3 <your_script.py>




**For Arduino Nano:
Ultrasonic Sensor:**

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
TRIG to D12 (pin in your code)
ECHO to D11 (pin in your code)

**GPS Module:**

TX to Arduino RX (pin 3 in your code)
RX to Arduino TX (pin 2 in your code)
VCC to 5V (check GPS module specs)
GND to GND
SIM800L GSM Module:

TX to Arduino RX (pin 2 in your code)
RX to Arduino TX (pin 3 in your code)
VCC to 5V
GND to GND


**Arduino Nano Setup (for Arduino-based code)**

Libraries to Install:
TinyGPS++ (for GPS):

**Install via Arduino IDE:**
Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries.
Search for TinyGPS++ and install it.
SoftwareSerial (for communication with GSM and GPS):

This is a built-in library in the Arduino IDE, so no need to install separately.
**eSpeak (for speech output):**

For buzzer sounds, you don't need extra libraries for the basic functionality as it uses direct GPIO control for buzzers.
Steps to Run:
**Install Arduino IDE:**

You can download the Arduino IDE from here.
Connect Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.

**Configure the Arduino IDE:**

Select the correct board type (Arduino Nano) and port.
Go to Tools -> Board -> Select Arduino Nano.
Select the correct COM port under Tools -> Port.
Upload the Sketch:

Open the code in Arduino IDE and click on Upload to transfer the code to the Arduino Nano.

**Wiring (for each project):**

Ultrasonic sensor: Connect the TRIG and ECHO pins to appropriate digital pins on the Nano (as specified in the code).
GPS Module: Connect the GPS module's TX/RX pins to the correct pins on the Arduino for communication.
SIM800L GSM module: Connect the GSM module's TX/RX to the Arduino's RX/TX pins.
